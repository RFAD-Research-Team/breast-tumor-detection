Breast Microwave Imaging (BMI) has emerged as a viable alternative to conventional breast cancer screening techniques due to its favorable features and a higher rate of detection. This paper presents a deep learning framework consisting of deep neural networks with convolutional layers to facilitate the process of tumor detection, localization, and characterization from scattering parameter measurements and metadata features.
